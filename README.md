# DS_resource
A repository where I store cheat sheets, tutorials, academic papers, and other helpful resources I come across. Continuously updated and organized by topic. Contributions welcome.

Welcome to my personal collection of notes and resources! This repository is a place where I store all the helpful notes, links, and resources I come across while working on various projects. It includes everything from cheat sheets and youtube tutorials to blog posts and academic papers.

I created this repository to not only keep track of useful information but also to share it with others who may find it helpful. The repository is divided into different folders, each containing notes and resources related to a specific topic or subject.

I will be actively adding to this repository as I come across new resources and notes. I hope that this collection will be useful for others in their own projects and studies. Please feel free to contribute to the repository by submitting pull requests or opening issues if you come across any errors or have suggestions for improvement.

Thank you for checking out my notes and resources collection!
